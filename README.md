**Problem statement!**

We have a Non-profit Organization called Harry J Lloyd  Charitable Trust located in Overland Park, Kansas city. In their recent survey, they found that maximum donors to the trust are earning more than 50,000 Us Dollars yearly. So the trust wanted to get more donors from all the US states and targeting state by state. We have millions of people working in the state. In order to reduce the cost of sending mail to the people who are willing to donate. We are building a Machine Learning algorithm. And the goal is to optimize and evaluate  various supervised machine learning algorithms and consecutively determine the algorithm which provides higher donations on less number of emails. 

**Proposed Solution!**
The proposed solution for the project involves developing a machine learning algorithm that can predict the likelihood of an individual donating to the Harry J Lloyd Charitable Trust. 
This will be achieved by analyzing and preprocessing the data collected by the trust to create a high-quality dataset. Various supervised machine learning algorithms will be evaluated to optimize the targeted marketing strategy, with the best-performing algorithm selected to reduce costs and improve campaign effectiveness. 
Standard evaluation metrics will be used to measure algorithm performance, providing insights and recommendations for non-profit organizations implementing machine learning techniques for targeted marketing and fundraising efforts. 
The proposed solution aims to enhance the trust's fundraising efforts, optimizing their targeted marketing strategy using machine learning techniques.
